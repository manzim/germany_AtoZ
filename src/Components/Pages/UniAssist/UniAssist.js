        Uni-Assist Journey
      </h2>

      <h3>Journey:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>FIRST APPEAR IN IELTS</strong> AND OBTAIN AT LEAST <strong>6.5 OVERALL</strong>
          (though <strong>5.5 is required minimum</strong> for the German Embassy in Bangladesh,
          but with that score, you'll struggle to match university requirements).

          <br /> My score was as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>Overall: <strong>6.5</strong></li>
            <li>Speaking: <strong>7.0</strong></li>
            <li>Reading: <strong>6.5</strong></li>
            <li>Listening: <strong>6.5</strong></li>
            <li>Writing: <strong>6.0</strong></li>
          </ul>
          <br /> 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Prepare Documents for Uni-Assist:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the website of Uni-Assist, there is a requirement given. Gather your documents as per that checklist.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then make xerox copies of all those certificates.
        </li>
        <li>
          Go to notarize them (cost varies from <strong>10 TK to 50 TK</strong>: bargain with them).
          I did my copies at <strong>10 TK/notary</strong> from Badda, Hossain Market.
        </li>
        <li>
          After the notary is done, send your documents to the address of Uni-Assist.
        </li>
      </ul><br /> <br />

      <h3>How to Send Documents to Uni-Assist:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You can send the documents by <strong>DHL, FedEx, or by local couriers</strong> also.
          I sent my docs by "<strong>Desh Courier, phone no - XXXX</strong>".
          They charged me <strong>2.5k TK</strong> (back in March '22) while both FedEx & DHL
          were asking for <strong>3.5k+- BDT</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul><br /> <br /> 

      <h3>Document Send Hack:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you know some people who'll also send documents to Uni-Assist, then gather all around,
          make a single envelope, and put all of your docs in that single envelope. Send them this way,
          and your cost per head will be lessened. 4 of my friends later that month sent in this way.
          They sealed their single envelope and gathered all 4 envelopes and put them inside one big
          envelope and sent it to Uni-Assist.
        </li>
        <li>
          When Uni-Assist opened the envelope, they found 4 persons' files.
        </li>
        <li>
          All of them got the document received acknowledgment email from Uni-Assist too (in due time).
        </li>
      </ul><br /> <br />

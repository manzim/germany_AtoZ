                        <li>
                            <strong>a. Apply Widely:</strong> With a CGPA below 3.0, casting a wide net by applying to multiple

            <h3>How I selected my universities:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> Since my CGPA was too low, I tried to filter out the courses too much while ensuring they're all NC.
                </li>
                <li>First I searched and listed down a wide range of courses from mygermanUniversities</li>
                <li>Filtered near about 10 courses</li>
                <li>Checked the courses in both daad.de to gather more requirements</li>
                <li>Double-Check how to apply: directly from uni-portal or through Uni-Assist</li>
                <li>If applying through Uni-Assist, then upload the documents in the Uni-assist portal</li>
                <li>I noted down the requirements and finally found 4 Unviersity that matches my scores and others (names given below).</li>
                <li><strong>N.B:</strong> Always check the requirements from the university dept. site too. I missed the CGPA requiement of two university. They were not present in either Daad.de or in MygermanUniversity. And guess what, I got rejected from both. </li>
            </ol>
            <br /> <br />
            <h3> University and Course I applied:</h3>
            <ol>
                <li> <strong>Hochschule für nachhaltige Entwicklung Eberswalde (HNEE)</strong>: Forest Information Technology </li>
                <li> <strong>Fachhochschule Kiel</strong>: Information Technology</li>
                <li> <strong>Berliner Hochschule für Technik</strong>: Data Science </li>
                <li> <strong>Technische Universität Chemnitz (TU)</strong>: Web Engineering</li>
                <li> <strong>Technische Hochschule Ingolstadt</strong>: Applied in following three course:
                    <ol>Design Leadership</ol>
                    <ol>Global Foresight & Technology Management</ol>
                    <ol>Engineering and Management</ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br /> <br />
